It would have two floors: the ground floor for shared spaces like the living room and kitchen, and the upper floor for bedrooms and a study.</p> <p>What special features it would have:</p> <p>I\u2019d like a spacious garden where I could grow flowers and vegetables, as well as a small patio for outdoor dining. Another dream feature would be a library room with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Finally, a smart home system to control lighting and security would be a must for convenience.</p> <p>And explain why it would be an ideal place for you:</p> <p>This house would be ideal for me because it combines comfort, functionality, and the chance to connect with nature. I think it would be the perfect place to relax after a long day and enjoy a slower pace of life.</p>"},{"location":"SPEAKING/PLACE%20MONOLOGUE/#6-describe-a-place-in-your-hometown-that-you-would-like-to-take-your-parentsfriends","title":"6. Describe a place in your hometown that you would like to take your parents/friends","text":"<p>Model Answer:</p> <p>One place in Ho Chi Minh City that I would love to take my parents and friends to is Ben Thanh Market, which is not only a bustling marketplace but also an iconic symbol of the city.</p> <p>What the place is:</p> <p>Ben Thanh Market is one of the oldest markets in Vietnam, and it\u2019s famous for its wide variety of goods, from fresh produce and traditional handicrafts to souvenirs and street food. It\u2019s a vibrant and lively spot that reflects the energy of Ho Chi Minh City.</p> <p>Where it is:</p> <p>The market is located in District 1, right in the city center. It\u2019s easy to get to by taxi or even by walking if you\u2019re nearby. The market is surrounded by famous landmarks, making it a convenient stop on any city tour.</p> <p>When you would like to visit there:</p> <p>I\u2019d like to take my parents or friends there during the daytime so we can explore the stalls and try some delicious local dishes like pho, banh xeo, or fresh spring rolls. Visiting in the evening is also an option because the area transforms into a night market with a different vibe.</p> <p>And explain why you would like to take your parents or friends there:</p> <p>I think Ben Thanh Market is a great place to experience the culture and lifestyle of the city. My parents would enjoy shopping for high-quality Vietnamese products like silk or coffee, while my friends might be more interested in trying street food or taking Instagram-worthy photos. Personally, I love the lively atmosphere and the chance to share the unique energy of Ho Chi Minh City with others.</p>"},{"location":"SPEAKING/Part1_SPEAKING/","title":"PART ONE","text":"","tags":["english"]},{"location":"SPEAKING/Part1_SPEAKING/#do-you-prefer-x-to-y","title":"DO YOU PREFER X TO Y?","text":"<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you prefer dry or wet weather?</p> <p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which do you prefer, e-books or paper-books?</p> <p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you prefer reading newspapers or magazines?(Why?)</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you prefer buying things from small or big companies?</p> <p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you prefer to study at home or study in other places?</p> <p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you like to spend time by yourself or with your friends ?
